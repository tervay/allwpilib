// Minimal stub implementation of ntcore for WebAssembly builds
// This provides just enough symbols for wpilibc to link against
// without requiring the full wpinet/ntcore implementation
// 
// Note: These are empty stubs - NetworkTables functionality is not available
// in WebAssembly builds, but wpilibc requires the symbols for linking.

// We'll include the actual headers but provide minimal implementations
// This allows the code to compile and link, even if NetworkTables won't work

// The actual implementation would need to match the ntcore interface,
// but for WebAssembly builds, we just need to satisfy the linker.
// Since ElevatorSim doesn't use NetworkTables, these stubs are sufficient.

// This file intentionally left mostly empty - the real ntcore headers
// will be included, and we'll provide minimal stub implementations
// through the CMake configuration that uses the actual headers but
// skips the problematic wpinet parts.
